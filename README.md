# AWAE PREP Layout

This repository will serve as the "master" repo containing all trainings and tutorials done in preperation for OSWE in conjunction with the AWAE course. This repo will likely contain custom code by me and varous courses. Below you can see in what order I completed these challenges / courses.

## Prep Breakdown

The following table shows notes, courses, challenges, and tutorials taken in preparation for the AWAE.

## Post Prep Breakdown

Having completed the course below, is everything done in regards to prep before the exam. If you have not taken the AWAE and are considering taking it definitely do everything shown above, and read the source! I have provided README's in each directory and source code so you can see what I did. I cannot share extra miles .... so those will not be within the repository. Best of luck!

- Complete all extra miles! I know some are harder than others but push through (one took me 8 days alone).
- Be comfortable using every debugger shown within the course.
- Be comfortable using all debuggers used throughout the course work.
- Understand Object Oriented Languages taught throughout the course. No need to be a master in each language, but be able to code something fast using existing libs.
- Be comfortable crafting a full POC (as done throughout the entire course)
- Look for vulnerabilities ;)

This may not seem like much, but it's what I did for prep. My best advice is DO NOT OVERTHINK things and don't rush through it. It took me 2 attempts when it should have taken one, I was jumping around not documenting enough what I was trying (It's easy to create your own rabbit holes...). Slow down you have 48 hours!
